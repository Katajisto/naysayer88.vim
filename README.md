This is an approximation of the colorscheme that Jonathan Blow uses in Emacs.

Some colors were copied from https://github.com/soulshined/Visual-Studio-Code-Naysayer88-Color-Theme, some were found using a color picking tool.
You are free to do anything you want with this.

Install this colorscheme with the vim package manager of your choice or by hand.

In order for this colorscheme to unfold its magic, you have to use a keyboard with Cherry MX Blue switches, preferably
an ergonmic one.
