This is an approximation of the colorscheme that Jonathan Blow uses in Emacs.
Some colors were copied from https://github.com/soulshined/Visual-Studio-Code-Naysayer88-Color-Theme, some were found using a color picking tool.
You are free to do anything you want with this.
Install this colorscheme with the vim package manager of your choice or by hand.
